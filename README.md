SOA Scripts, sense of achivement, 成就感

# The purpose of this repo
Learning to code is a whole new journey to me. This journey is tough and I really need to push myself to go forward. During this journey, a small progress could mean a lot to me and motivate me to go further. It's called positive feedback loop. I really need the sense of achivement. So, I am writing down these small scripts that can do some nice and tricky jobs. They can amuse me and remind me how fun coding could be.
